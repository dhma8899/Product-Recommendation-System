## Description of the Project
In this project, a recommendation system was built using the Apriori algorithm and by applying association rules. As a result, it was possible to determine items frequently bought together by customers. Given an item as the input, our project can provide the most suitable items as recommendation based on the purchasing patterns observed as per the transaction history of different stores. This project can assimilate data from multiple stores and determine the association rules for the items.

## Summary of the questions sought and the answers
Through this project we intend to identify customer purchasing patterns by analyzing the items purchased in sequence to determine cross sell. For this project we have consider data from multiple platform store to get relevant interesting patterns for that store platform.

By Identifying this interesting pattern, we can increase the sales by optimizing the product placement, offer special deals and creating product bundle to encourage further sales of these combination. Popularly used in Amazon, Walmart, Target, and many more.

## Application of this knowledge
This project can be leveraged for a variety of applications.

The direct application of this project is a recommendation system. Providing suggestions to customers on items that they could be interested in based on the items that they bought. This would help improve sales.

Additionally, these insights help the store in determining the best layout for displaying the items. Items frequently bought together could be placed close to each other to help provide the customer with easy access to these items.

If the stores were to place new orders for items, this knowledge could also be used to see if orders could be placed on items frequently bought together at once.

Providing discounts on prices on combinations of item bought together would further incentivize the customers to buy them and in turn help drive the sales.
